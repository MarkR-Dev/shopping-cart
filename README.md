Areas that could be improved:

- Structure data with consideration for all aspects of the project so you don't have to quick fix issues down the line
- UI/CSS - most notably the use of svgs/icons and tab indicators for header, among several other small issues
- UI/CSS - better repsonsive breakpoints that are in sync with all elements
- Accessible semantic html to aid assitive technologies/allow for better querying via RTL
- Testing - over tested? tested things incorrectly? better testing query/userEvents, create tests before pages/components rather than after or during
- More Testing - a better understanding about what I should be testing, and how to create components that makes it easier to create tests
- Creating more re-usable components that are easier to test in isolation
- Fixing the PropType issue (reverting to old react version or finding another package)
- Using the error variable in components to render a different version of a component when something is wrong in the useFetchProducts
- Maybe using context api to pass props around and manage state would have been better, could have made it easier to test and avoid minor prop drilling
- Check some examples of better react design practices and how to structure and test a react project
- Quantity inputs could have probably been one component instead of two
- Research into scroll restoration

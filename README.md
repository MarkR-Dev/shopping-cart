Areas that could be improved:

- UI/CSS - most notably the use of svgs/icons and tab indicators for header
- Accessible semantic html to aid assitive technologies/allow for better querying via RTL
- Testing - over tested? tested things incorrectly? create tests before pages/components rather than after or during
- Creating more re-usable components that are easier to test in isolation
- Fixing the PropType issue (reverting to old react version or finding another package)
- Using the error variable in components to render a different version of a component when something is wrong in the useFetchProducts
- Maybe using context api to pass props around and manage state would have been better, could have made it easier to test
